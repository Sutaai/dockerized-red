# Dockerized Red

![Dockerized Red Logo](docs/assets/dockerized-red.png)

This Docker image provides you a declarative way to fire up an instance of [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creator/Red-DiscordBot).

I made my own image due to lot of frustration using PhasecoreX's Docker image which proved tedious setup and difficult startup. My differences are way beyond a simple pull request I could make.
