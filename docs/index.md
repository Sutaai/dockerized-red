# Dockerized Red - Declarative image of Red-DiscordBot

![Dockerized Red logo](assets/dockerized-red.png)

This is the documentation for the Dockerized Red image. A declarative image for [Red-DiscordBot](https://github.com/Cog-Creator/Red-DiscordBot) made by [Sutaai](https://sutaai.dev/).

⚠️ **Remember:** Docker is an unsupported way to run Red-DiscordBot. I provide no support either. This is just a fun project for me.
You are expected to know what you are doing, and how to mangle with Docker, your terminal, your machine, and how to administrate your bot's instance.

ℹ️ **By the way:** This is a very recent project. It isn't mature enough yet. Feel free to toy around.

## Get me started

Choose your champion:

- Do you wish to quickly see Red-DiscordBot for yourself? Use [the Docker guide](user_guides/use-docker.md).
- Do you wish to host a bot more permanently? Use [the Docker Compose guide](user_guides/use-docker-compose.md).
- Need to see which options are available to you? Check out the [reference of variables](references/variables.md).
